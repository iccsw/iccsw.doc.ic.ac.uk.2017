The 2015 Imperial College Computing Student Workshop aims to provide an
international forum for doctoral students to discuss a range of topics
that are current in computer science research. The workshop welcomes all
research students in the field of computer science.

Following the success of the first four editions of the
workshop&mdash;[ICCSW'14](http://iccsw.doc.ic.ac.uk/2014),
[ICCSW'13](http://iccsw.doc.ic.ac.uk/2013),
[ICCSW'12](http://iccsw.doc.ic.ac.uk/2012) and
[ICCSW'11](http://iccsw.doc.ic.ac.uk/2011)&mdash;the fifth workshop
provides an excellent opportunity to share provocative ideas,
interesting preliminary work, or a cool research directions that may
change the world.

The workshop aims to:

* offer research students the opportunity to submit and present their
  research at an internationally-renowned institution;
* provide PhD students with the experience of organising a workshop,
  including reviewing papers written by other students;
* provide a forum for open discussion of topics including those outside
  the current focus of research;
* allow students to network with peers from other institutions and learn
  about their research.

The workshop provides an excellent ground for discussing similarities
and differences in graduate studies at various institutions around the
world. All doctoral students are thereby encouraged to submit papers
covering their ongoing research. The fifth edition of the workshop is
currently being planned.
